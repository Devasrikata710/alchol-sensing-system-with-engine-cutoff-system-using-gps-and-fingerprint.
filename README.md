# üöó Revolutionizing Road Safety with Intelligent Alcohol Detection and Engine Control System

 *Alcohol Detection System with Engine Cutoff Using Fingerprint and GPS* ‚Äî a smart solution designed to reduce drunk driving incidents and prevent vehicle misuse.

---
## üîé Project Overview

The system is designed to:

- Detect the driver's alcohol concentration when the vehicle is turned on.
- Automatically shut off the engine if alcohol concentration is above the safe threshold.
- Require the driver to verify their identity via fingerprint to restart the vehicle.
- Recheck alcohol levels after fingerprint authentication before enabling the engine.
- Send alerts with location information via GPS if invalid or delayed fingerprint input is detected.
- Prevent vehicle misuse with added security against theft or unauthorized use.

üîê This not only ensures the driver is fit to drive but also adds an extra layer of anti-theft and unconscious-driver protection.

| Component               | Purpose                                                             
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------     |
| MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor     | Measures driver‚Äôs breath alcohol concentration                           |
| R307 Fingerprint Sensor | Authenticates driver‚Äôs fingerprint before enabling the engine            |
| GPS Module              | Sends alert messages with live location in case of misuse or danger      |
| Relay Module            | Cuts off engine power when alcohol level is high or authentication fails |
| DC Motor                | Acts as a simulated engine for testing engine cutoff functionality       |
| 16x2 LCD Display        | Displays alcohol level, fingerprint status, and system messages          |

 üì∏ How It Works

- When the vehicle is turned on, the system immediately measures the driver‚Äôs alcohol level using the MQ-3 sensor.
- If alcohol concentration is above the threshold, the engine is disabled by controlling the relay module.
- To restart the engine, the driver must pass fingerprint authentication using the R307 sensor.
- The system rechecks alcohol levels after fingerprint verification before enabling the relay.
- If the fingerprint is invalid or not provided within the allowed time, the engine remains disabled and a GPS alert is sent to predefined contacts.
- The LCD screen provides real-time feedback on alcohol levels, fingerprint status, and system warnings.
